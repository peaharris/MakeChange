        //Check to see if the purchase price is greater than zero.If it is not greater than zero,
        //then loop and have the user re-enter the purchase price
        //After the user has entered both the purchase amount and the payment amount, use one of the
        //iteration statements from this chapter in order to:

        //Check to see if the payment is enough.If it isn't enough, loop so that you ask for both
        //the purchase price and the payment again. As long as the payment isn't enough, you should
        //continue to loop and ask for the amounts again.When the payment is finally enough, you should
        //compute and print out the change as before and end.
        //Note: This will require some amount of finesse, a good understanding of loops, and some creative thinking.
        //In order to get both parts done, it will probably require one loop (purchase price > 0)  to be inside of
        //another loop (payment is enough). Also, only two loops are needed.If you have more than two loops in your
        //solution, you might want to see if you can re-work your program to get it down to only two loops.
